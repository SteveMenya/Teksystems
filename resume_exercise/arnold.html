    <p class="bio">
        Arnold Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947, near Graz, Austria. He rose to fame as the world's top
        bodybuilder, launching a career that would make him a giant Hollywood star via films like Conan the Barbarian,
        The Terminator and Total Recall. After years of blockbuster movie roles, Schwarzenegger went into politics,
        becoming governor of California in 2003. He returned to the big screen after leaving office in 2011, finding
        success with The Expendables franchise and a return to the Terminator series. Arnolds simple bio

                    in B-level Hercules movies. The films also helped propel Schwarzenegger's own obsession with
                    America, and the future he felt awaited him there. Getting to his new country was the issue.
                    Schwarzenegger found his answer in Joe Weider, the man behind the International Federation of Body

                    With his ascension to the top of the bodybuilding world, it was only a matter of time before
                    Schwarzenegger would move over to the big screen. After a few small parts, Schwarzenegger received a
                    Golden Globe Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Stay Hungry (1976)

                    At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his "cheerful,
                    good-humored, and exuberant" character.[21] Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger
                    recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.[24]
                    Schwarzenegger's father Gustav was an athlete, and wished for his sons to become a champion in
                    Bavarian curling.[26] Influenced by his father, Schwarzenegger played several sports as a boy.[21]
